In order to use the applications, a user has to sign in. A user can be:
  a) manager
  b) client
Both a manager and a client can see the list of cars.
A manager can add, delete and update cars. Also, a manager can see a chart in which are represented the number of cars belonging to a brand.
A client can buy cars, if he is connected to the Internet. He receives a confirmation email each time he buys a car. If he presses on the image of a car, the image is zoomed in.
